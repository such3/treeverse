# Tree Adoption Platform

A digital platform built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to facilitate **tree adoption**, **environmental awareness**, and **sustainability initiatives**. Users can adopt trees, monitor their health, donate for tree plantation, and collaborate with volunteers to plant and maintain trees.

This platform aims to bring individuals and organizations together to combat **deforestation** and promote **biodiversity**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- MongoDB (or use MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn (package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tree-adoption-platform.git
   cd tree-adoption-platform
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:

   Navigate to the backend directory (`/server`) and run:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   Navigate to the frontend directory (`/client`) and run:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the `/server` folder with the following keys:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_for_email_notifications
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key_for_payment
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual keys.

5. **Run the project**:

   - Start the backend server:

     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```

   - Start the frontend development server:

     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
